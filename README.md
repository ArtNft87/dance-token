### **Audit Information**

The Dancecoin token is a standard SPL token created using the Solana Token Program. The mint authority will be permanently revoked upon creation, ensuring a fixed and unchangeable total supply.

This repository will be provided to auditors like Certik or Hacken for verification. The key verification points are the fixed supply and the disabled mint authority, which can be confirmed on the Solana blockchain explorer once the token is launched.
